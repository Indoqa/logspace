#Spaces

[Spaces](/multiple-spaces) have to be defined as files in the directory configured with the property `logspace.hq-webapp.space-tokens-directory`.

The filename is **space** with the extension **space-tokens**.

Example content of demo.space-tokens

```
demo1234
```

Where `demo` is the space and `demo1234` is an authentication token for this space.
